# Paginator LWC
## Features:
1. Component should get pages number via @api numberPages variable
2. Also you can pass select options for number records picklist. If you don't pass any select options,
they will be the default (5, 10, 15) records on page.
Example: selectOptions = [
            {label: 10, value: 10},
            {label: 20, value: 20},
            {label: 30, value: 30}
        ];
3. When you click on buttons this component creates events for parent component. 
4. You can test c-paginator on my org: paginator@task.com password: 29051983s

Component name is paginator. To test paginator you should use component that called testComponent.

## Good luck!
